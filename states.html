    <h1>Ranking of States Websites</h1>

    <h2><a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a></h2>
    <p>Vermont's web page out of all of the others was the first to really pop out at me from the start. Entering the home page, the web site has a very pleasant image of the State Capitol Building surrounded by an amazing fall folage scene. This is a very inviting and enjoyable experiance for the user that makes the site more approachable than others. The next aspect of the web site that I liked was the big search bar that was front and center asking "I want to...". The web site had a very nice navigation bar at the top that was simplistic, but also very classy looking along with their logo. The site allowed quick and easy access to quick links that were most important to citizens in the state including COVID resources, unemployment, and economic recovery. Finally, it was a nice touch to put all of the statewide officials and links to their information on the home page to allow the users to get familiar with those who are running the state they reside in. Finally, the pages resize properly when being adjusted and the pages all work and are just as professional as the home page.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></h3>
    <p>Tennesse's web site is the perfect area between simplistic and complex. The web site has a menu bar across the top that contains additional links to other pages through the navigation bar that is very easy to use and also has man drop down options for those looking to get a more indepth look at certain information. On the other hand, it provides a very simple approach to those who are not as technologicly advanced or are looking for a quick and easy search through the general subjects. Additionally, it also has a news section that tells about all of the breaking current news from around the state and lists all public meeting information in a full calender. Lastly, it has a nice look to the web page and does not let the color scheme or unnecessary props hinder the cleanliness of the site. The only negative I would apply with the web site is that the code looks slightly scattered. There is a lot of blank spaces between and the lines seem to snake around the page more than I would like it to. </p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.oklahoma.gov">Oklahoma</a></h4>
    <p>The Oklahoma web page is a finely laid out piece of work. When the user initially reaches the home page, they are not bombarded with excessive junk, but are instead left with a simplistic, yet visually pleasing web site that is applicable to users of all ages. Next, the web site works well in all different dimensions of screen size and is constantly resizing and adjusting to fit the appropriate space. When looking at the code used for this web site, it is very organized and put together in a way that would be fairly easy to fix if an issue was to occur. Lastly, it contains a search bar at the top of the page that is useful and works well to look up diffenrt things in the web site. The only thing that I would have liked to see on the page would have been either a menu bar across the top of the screen or a three bar options menu to guide the user to differnt parts of the page. </p>

    <h5><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></h5>
    <p>Upon opening the home page of the State of Iowa, the first thing that I noticed was that the image in the header was sized somewhat poorly and left a lot of blank space that looked awkward to me. If I was to fix this section of the page I would simply move up the "This is Iowa" wording so it is the first thing seen while entering, and then additionally making the background image smaller so that it fits the screen with no excess. The only other negative that I would include within this website would be the ammount of unnecessary content on the home page. In my opinion, the home page is much too crowded and could potentially disorientate the user on first glance. Instead, I think it would work better if some of the more specialized facts and links were in a seperate page. The aspect of the web site that is most appealing is the "Quick Links" that are located right at the beginning of the home page. They are easy to navigate and help guide the user to the most important sections. Lastly, the search bar at the top of the page is very convienient and works well to help find certain areas of the web site.</p>

    <h6><a href="https://www.alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h6>
    <p>The Alaska state home page needs a decent amount of work in my opinion. Upon entering the web page, the reader can easily tell that it is quite obsolete and needs a generous renovation. On first glance, the page does not take up the whole page and has rounded edges that makes the web page look very 2000's in apperance. Additonally, nothing on the page really makes it stand out or pop to the reader. It is extemely bland and leaves much to be desired by the average technological person. The fianl issue with the page is that it does not resize properly when adjusting the screen. When trying to make the page smaller, it stays in format for a small amount of time, then eventually does not respond well, and then makes the user have to slide the bar at the bottom to see the rest of the page. However, not all of the web page is bad, on the other hand it is quite easy to access and is very simplisitc. It provides a very easy path for Alaskian citizens to find a job, obtain a hunting license, or register themselves to vote. For a person with lesser technical skills, this webstie would be ideal becuase of its simplicity. Lastly, it is laid out in a professional manner that does not take away from the key elements of the states identity or mission.</p>
