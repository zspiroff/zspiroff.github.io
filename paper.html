        <p> For this assingment, I chose three different websites to analize and pick two good, and one bad website. The first website that I chose was ESPN. This website is extremely user friendly and professional. I typically use ESPN multiple times per day and it is also consistent and provides me with fresh and current sporting news. The best part of the website is its simplicity and accesibility in navigating to all different parts of the website. It contains a navigation area on the top of the page that will easily take you to any of the multiple major sports in the U.S. On the right hand side of the home page, it has a section with all of the most recent and important headlines that is easy to manuever and access. When changing the area of the screen, the content is also changed in order to fit the alloted space and resizes nicely. The color scheme is also a nice touch as it does not overpower the user, but maintains the constant ESPN logo and colors that the users are accustomed to. The coding of the page is extensive, but it is laid out in an easy way and looks to be formated clearly. My favorite part of the website is its headlines column because it proivdes a quick way to find all of the top stories of the day to keep me up to date during the day. </p>
        <p> The next website that I decided to choose for one that I liked was FoxNews. FoxNews is a website that I frequent a lot during the day to keep up to date with the general news. This website provides me with information that I find relevant and interesting and is certainly my perfered news source. This website does a good job of laying out all of the different areas of interest in the upper navigation section. This makes it very easy for the user to find what they want and dive deeper into certain aspects of a topic. I also appreciate that the website has the top three index funds for the stock market right at the top of the page. I enjoy seeing the featured videos that are located within the margain that provide an entertaining touch to the site. The color scheme is almost nonexistent on the site, which in my opinion is not a bad thing for a news site. This website keeps the presentation very professional and does not undermine the headlines by using an overpowering or distracting scheme. The coding of the page is also set up in an effective manner that uses html5 elements. All in all this is a good website because it is not over the top in terms of complexity while still maintaing an efficent news website.</p>
        <p>The final website that I picked was the Montana State University Northerns athletic website. Overall I think this website is poor for many reasons, but the main aspect is how sparatic the entire site is. This website is very confusing and has a multitude of different things and links on its home page that makes it feek very unorganized. When I first arrived on the home page it made me feel unhappy and I was not pleased. The color scheme is not visually appealing at all and there is nothing on the site that really makes it pop, which makes the entire site feels boring an unappealing. Additionally, the bar at the bottom of the page is very hard to read because it is very small and also the color does not stick out against the background color. Lastly, the code is very unorganized and is extremly confusing to me as I would expect it would feel to others. I dislike this website for many reasons and I feel that it should be redone and given a better color scheme, more intresting attributes to make it stand out, a fixed news bar at the bottom and a cleaner code. It is for these reasons that I put this website as the one that I feel is poorly done. </p>
